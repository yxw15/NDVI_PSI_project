# Spectral Analysis of Soil Water Potential Time Series
# Author: Yixuan Wang
# Date: Sys.Date() (update as needed)

# This script demonstrates how to perform spectral analysis on a soil water potential time series
# extracted from a SpatRaster. The steps include:
#   1. Data Preparation: Filtering the dataset for "Pine" species, selecting the required columns,
#      converting the 'year' column to numeric, and reshaping the data to wide format (each year as a separate column).
#   2. Conversion to SpatRaster: Creating a SpatRaster using the spatial coordinates.
#   3. Random Pixel Analysis: Randomly selecting one pixel with a valid time series.
#   4. Detrending: Removing the long-term trend via a simple linear regression.
#   5. Spectral Analysis: Computing the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) of the detrended series,
#      calculating the power spectrum, and constructing the frequency vector.
#   6. Log-Log Transformation and Regression: Transforming frequency and power values using logarithms,
#      and fitting a linear model to estimate the spectral exponent.
#
# The spectral exponent is defined by the equation:
#   log10(P(f)) = a + b * log10(f)
# where P(f) is the power at frequency f, a is the intercept, and b is the spectral exponent.
# A more negative value of b indicates that low-frequency (long-term) fluctuations dominate.

# Conclusion
# -----------------------------
# In this script we:
#   1. Filtered and reshaped the dataset, then converted it to a SpatRaster.
#   2. Randomly selected one pixel with a valid time series.
#   3. Removed the long-term trend from the time series using linear regression.
#   4. Performed spectral analysis by computing the FFT and the power spectrum on both detrended and original data.
#   5. Transformed the frequency and power data to logarithmic scales and fitted linear regressions,
#      where the slopes of the regressions give the spectral exponents.
#
# The spectral exponent provides insight into the temporal dynamics of the soil water potential time series.
# A more negative spectral exponent indicates dominance by long-term, low-frequency fluctuations.
# Comparing the slopes from detrended and original data shows how trends affect the spectral analysis.
